    <h1>A React App for Finding and Choosing Tasks</h1>

    <div id="toc_container">
        <ul class="toc_list" style="padding-left: 0;">
            <li><a href="#goal">1 Goal of the application and value to a user</a></li>

    </div>

    <h2 id="goal">Goal of the application and value to a user</h2>

    <p><b>Goal: </b>This app allows a user to sort and filter a series of tasks to see which tasks are for school, work, or personal applications and how long they take. It then allows the user to pick which tasks they want to complete and calculates the total amount of time it will take to do the chosen tasks.</p>

    <p><b>Value: </b>Users can more easily visualize tasks and organize them within a to-do list. This helps them to stay on top of whatever tasks and prioritize the ones they want to do today!</p>

    <h2 id="usability">Usability principles considered</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Color contrast: </b>The colors used within this app were chosen such that they contrasted appropriately with the background, allowing each task's border and colorful tags to be visible.</li>
        <li><b>Hierarchy: </b>Headers with different sizes and colors were used to distinguish between the title (on a banner), the two parts of the app ("Task Options" and "My Tasks"), and the filters. For a given task, colors and sizing were used to distinguish between the name of the task, the tags, and associated buttons.</li>
        <li><b>Responsiveness: </b>Flexboxes were used to arrange both the two parts of the app and the items within the "Task Options" section. This ensures that this app works well when the screen size is smaller or larger within a desktop/laptop window.</li>
        <li><b>Learnability: </b>The app's buttons are descriptive and there are not more than necessary, allowing the user to quickly understand what each interaction will do.</li>
        <li><b>Memorability: </b>The images for tasks and color coding of each type of task allows users to quickly begin to associate certain tasks with certain visuals.</li>
    </ul>
